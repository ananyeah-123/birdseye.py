## 🏎️ CARLA Multi-Vehicle Manual Control Interface

This repository provides an extended manual control interface for the [CARLA Simulator](https://carla.org/), enabling real-time control and visualization of multiple vehicles. Inspired by CARLA's `manual_control.py`, this version supports:

### 🔧 Features

* 🚘 **Spawn and control multiple vehicles** on the map
* 🔁 **Switch control between cars** using a single key (`C`)
* 🧭 **Three camera perspectives**:

  * Bird's-eye (mouse-pan and zoomable)
  * Chase (3rd-person follow)
  * Driver (1st-person dashboard)
* 🧠 **Manual driving controls** identical to `manual_control.py`:

  * Reverse gear (`Q`)
  * Manual gear shifting (`M`, `,`, `.`)
  * Handbrake (`Space`)
  * Autopilot toggle (`P`)
  * Constant velocity mode (`Ctrl + W`)
* 🧩 **Camera sensor switching** (`RGB`, `Depth`, `Semantic Segmentation`)
* 🗺️ **Mini-map overlay** for visualizing all vehicles
* 🧾 **On-screen HUD**: speed, gear, active car ID, camera mode
* 📜 **In-app help menu** (`H`) and HUD toggle (`F1`)

### 🚀 Getting Started

1. Launch CARLA:

   ```bash
   ./CarlaUE4.sh    # or CarlaUE5.sh depending on your version
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   cd PythonAPI/examples
   python3 multi_control_manualstyle.py
   ```

### 💡 Requirements

* Python 3.8–3.10
* [CARLA Simulator 0.9.13+](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases)
* `pygame`:

  ```bash
  pip install pygame
  ```
